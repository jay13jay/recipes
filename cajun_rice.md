    1/3 cup unsalted butter
    1/2 red bell pepper seeded and diced
    1/2 green bell pepper seeded and diced
    1/2 yellow onion diced
    3 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth

    Add the butter to a medium-sized saucepan over medium-high heat. Do not allow the butter to burn. As soon as the butter has melted, add the diced peppers and onion and stir to coat. Saut√© for 5-7 minutes until softened.

    Add the chicken broth, salt, garlic powder, thyme, paprika, pepper, and bay leaf to the saucepan and allow the mixture to come to a boil.

    After the resting time, fluff the rice with a fork, serve and enjoy!
